# ðŸ“¦ IMO

IMO stands for **I**nteroperable **M**etaverse **O**bject.

## What is IMO?

At a basic level, an IMO is just a glTF-binary file that can be used on any platform that support glTF-binary without any additional effort.

What makes an IMO special is that it includes metadata and assets that describe a classified interoperable metaverse object such as a vehicle, mount, pet or almost anything else.

Platforms can use progressive enhancement by adopting IMO types at their own pace, while still allowing people to use them as simple interoperable 3D models.

## How does it work?

IMO is a regular glTF-binary file embedded with the following:

1. A json schema describing a specific IMO type.
1. Assets such as audio and images.
