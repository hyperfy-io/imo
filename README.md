# IMO

IMO stands for **I**nteroperable **M**etaverse **O**bject.

## What is IMO?

At it's simplest, an IMO is just a glTF-binary file that can be used on any platform that support glTF-binary without any additional effort.

But an IMO also includes metadata that describes a classified interoperable metaverse object such as a vehicle, mount, pet or almost anything else.

Platforms are able to support any of the IMO types they want to enhance their behavior, or can choose to ignore them and treat them as regular interoperable 3D models.

## How does it work?

IMO is a regular glTF-binary file embedded with the following:

1. A json schema describing a specific IMO
1. Assets such as audio, images etc

## Types
